# Petridish-Ogar
Want to make an agario clone that'll have lots of custom modes, good physics and won't lag like hell? Petridish Ogar is for you!
# Client and Server
The client is based on petridish.pw's client. The server is based on MultiOgar ([this version](https://github.com/Barbosik/MultiOgar/commit/f09541954419f5bc6e6f9ef000446fdc1c36913d)), however, due to protocol changes, protocol 4/5/6 clients will not be able to connect to it. Use the client included by default.
# Petridish Ogar server features
Minions
Improved cell collisions
Custom Petridish.pw modes
Food grow
Improved performance up to 20% compared to MultiOgar
Map flipping - anti-teaming measure from vanilla (No more saying like "Go to top left corner"). Teamers will end up in different corners!
Mass gain factor - gain only some mass instead of all when eating other players' cells - a better alternative to anti-teaming
Extra Minion features - give minions to players by default, change their starting mass and speed
# Demo
[Play on the demo server.](http://polarsbots.ml/)
512 cells with 14 mass - semi-stable (need to arrange cells to avoid jitter)
